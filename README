Welcome to the RightScale cookbook repository!  

Let's git cookin'

Please fork yourself a version of this repo for all of your cookbook development.
Only commit cookbooks here that are complete, documented, and ready for QA testing.

In the repository, you'll find:

    * config/ - Top-level directory for general config files to configure the repository to support the RightScale environment. 
    * cookbooks/ - The RightScale cookbooks. <<<< Place your cookbooks here!
    * Rakefile - Sets up the rake tasks for managing the repository. (use 'rake metadata' to add metadata to your cookbooks!) 
    * roles/ - You can define node roles here. (Will we support roles?) 
    * site-cookbooks/ - usage is TBD.

To begin developing, create a new branch and add it to your local repository. For example, to create a branch foo, do:

  git clone git@github.com:rightscale/cookbooks.git
  cd cookbooks/
  git push origin origin:refs/heads/fo
  git checkout --track -b foo  origin/foo
