Welcome to the RightScale cookbook repository!  

Let's git cookin'

To begin developing, create a new branch and add it to your local repository. For example, to create a branch foo, do:

  git clone git@github.com:rightscale/cookbooks.git
  cd cookbooks/
  git push origin origin:refs/heads/foo
  git checkout --track -b foo origin/foo

Only commit cookbooks here that are complete, documented, and ready for QA testing.

In the repository, you'll find:

  config/         - usage is TBD.
  cookbooks/      - The RightScale cookbooks. <<<< Place your cookbooks here!
  Rakefile        - use 'rake metadata' to add metadata to your cookbooks.
  roles/          - usage is TBD.
  site-cookbooks/ - usage is TBD.
